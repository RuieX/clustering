1. d

Perform classification of the  [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (or a sufficiently small subset of it) using:

* mixture of Gaussians with diagonal covariance (Gaussian Naive Bayes with latent class label);
* mean shift;
* normalized cut.
* 
The unsupervised classification must be performed at varying levels of dimensionality reduction through PCA  (say going from 2 to 200) 
In order to asses the effect of the dimensionality in accuracy and learning time.

Provide the code and the extracted clusters as the number of clusters k varies from 5 to 15, 
for the mixture of Gaussians and normalized-cut, while for mean shift vary the kernel width. 
For each value of k (or kernel width) provide the value of the Rand index:

R=2(a+b)/(n(n-1))

where
* n is the number of images in the dataset.
* a is the number of pairs of images that represent the same digit and that are clustered together.
* b is the number of pairs of images that represent different digits and that are placed in different clusters.
Explain the differences between the three models.

**Tip**: the means of the Gaussian models can be visualized as a greyscale images after PCA reconstruction to inspect the learned model.
